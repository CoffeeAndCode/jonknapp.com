title: Hello Jekyll
---

**"Enough!"** I yelled shaking my fist at the ceiling of the coffee shop.
My website is completely out of date and does a horrible job representing
my skills as a developer.

2013 is the year for change.

I decided to create a site in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) that utilizes
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) formatted files.
Jekyll runs from the command line and creates a static version of your website
for deployment anywhere that hosts html, css, and javascript.

I'll be hosting the site on [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3). It's dead simple
to use and has the possibility to upgrade for caching and load balancing your
files through [CloudFront](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront).

If you'd like to dig your teeth into an actual Jekyll project, the
[source code for my website](https://github.com/CoffeeAndCode/jonknapp.com) is
hosted on Github and is *thankfully* (at least currently) a work in progress.
