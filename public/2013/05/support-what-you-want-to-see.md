A few years ago I caught a talk by [Jeff Finley](http://www.jefffinley.org/) of
[GoMedia](http://gomedia.us/) about how to land the type of work that you want
more of. His advice was to *only display the work that you want*.
If your portfolio shows a bunch of websites for law firms and you really want
to work with bands, guess what type of people will call you? Lawyers.
and nobody wants that.

If you want to land band websites, show off band websites! People are going
to relate you to the work that you produce and promote. By displaying things
that you want to do more of, people will instinctually associate you with
that type of work.

My small twist on Jeff's nugget of wisdom is to *support the type of
things that you want to see in the world*. I try to go above and beyond to help
things I am interested in succeed by:

* telling my friends and spreading the word about it
* volunteering time to promote or pull it off
* supporting the event financially by sponsoring it

Here's a description of the upcoming [Weapons of Mass Creation Fest](http://wmcfest.com/),
a conference that Jeff now throws every year in Cleveland, OH and one which
I've supported every year of its existence through KickStarters and sponsorships:

> The Weapons of Mass Creation Fest is the premier art, design, and music
> event in the Midwest. Now in its fourth year, 1,200+ attendees will
> descend upon Cleveland for three days in August to see 20 speakers,
> 20 designers, and over 30 bands. Creative professionals, entrepreneurs,
> musicians, artists, students, and fans will gather to learn, get inspired,
> collaborate, network, and celebrate together.

I'm really getting into sponsoring events and conferences with
company dollars. Do I get work from these type of sponsorships? Not really.
However, I get to support something that brings together people like me
in my own backyard. That is much more important than a three month contract.

I recognize where I would be without [Weapons of Mass Creation Fest](http://wmcfest.com/),
[Web Design Day](http://www.webdesignday.com/), and [Steel City Ruby](http://steelcityruby.org/),
which is why I choose to support their longevity and the benefit they provide
to my local tech community.

I hope to meet a lot of you at these events later in the year.
