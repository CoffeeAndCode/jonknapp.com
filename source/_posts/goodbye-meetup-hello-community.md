It's been a long, rewarding, and mentally exhausting ride.

I've been running meetups in the northeast Ohio area for the past four years
and it has been extremely rewarding. I've made a lot of friends, many great
business connections, and leveled up my understanding about technology and people.
However, about a year ago I was really starting to lose steam.

### A Little History

I had been the sole manager of the [Akron/Canton Web Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/akroncantonweb)
for quite a few years and I never really thought much about it. We'd have
meetings when we had a speaker lined up and get pretty good turnouts. Over time,
our meetings got farther apart and energy levels started to drop with the group.

Around this time I reached out to a few other meetup groups to see if anyone
was interested in partnering. If I was having issues managing the group by myself,
I thought they'd be interested in sharing the responsibility of management and
we could each get a bit more personal time out of it. Unfortunately, nobody else
was into the idea and polietly declined.

### Energy Level < 9000

Trying to find help in a low energy group is an extremely exhausting experience.
The meetups we had set expectations inappropriately with people RSVP'ing for events
they never intended to visit. That would lead to uncomfortable conversations with
speakers and no chance for a return talk. Who wants to prepare another presentation
for a group where only a quarter of the RSVP's show up? Ends up that nobody wanted to.

Then new meetups started popping up in the same area, on the same topics. Needless
to say, not having anyone reach out to talk about collaboration while I was already
wrestling with what to do with the group was a bit of a low blow. Instead of coming
together, it appeared as though we were deliberately trying to stretch our already
small community thinner. Was anything malicous meant by the act of creating another
group? Not at all! (at least I hope not) But it was definetly not good for energy levels.

### Make Time For What You Love

I began focusing on thing that I was interested in and created a group called
Music Mondays with my friend [Joe Canatti](https://twitter.com/JoeCannatti). I
had always wanted to play music and had grown tired of hearing people constantly
complaining that they "wish they could, but didn't have the time". So we started
bringing instruments to work on the [LeanDog](http://www.leandog.com/) boat to
remove people's excuses.

It was a great success, especially personally. It was great to focus on doing
something that didn't tether me to other people's attendance to justify the event.

Lately, I've been interested in events that have no barrier to entry, like The
[Akron Tech Breakfast](http://discuss.akron.io/t/akron-tech-breakfast-every-tuesday-at-7am/14) and
[Creative Folks Towpath Bike Ride](http://discuss.akron.io/t/towpath-bike-riding/21).
Both are setup to not put much weight on RSVP counts so we can instead focus on
conversations with the people who show up.

### Akron.io

With an amazing team of people, I'm starting to rethink what it is that I want
to provide to the community. We're starting with a focus on collaboration with other
groups and delegated responsibilities. I want to build something great and have it
be maintainable.

If you think it sounds like a good idea, we'd love to have ya. You can sign up
at [http://akron.io](http://akron.io) for the weekly newsletter and jump into
discussions at [http://discuss.akron.io](http://discuss.akron.io). If we're going
to succeed, we are only going to make it together.

### Summary

Could I have done this by maintaining the Akron/Canton Web Meetup? Possibly. However,
I'm not sure I would have been able to detach myself from the mental baggage I
had personally accumulated over the years. I am looking forward to a fresh start
and the amazing things that we'll be able to build together.
