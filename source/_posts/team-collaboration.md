I recently gave a talk to the [Akron / Canton Web Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/akroncantonweb/)
about [Team Collaboration](http://www.meetup.com/akroncantonweb/events/103302972/). The talk
was well received and you can view the current version of it here:

I told the group that over the past seven years that I've been consulting, communication
is the leading cause of problems in projects. Poor communication can sink projects, wreck
companies, and foster a work environment that stifles inginuity. I was glad to finally get
some thoughts to slides and help inform others about the topic.
